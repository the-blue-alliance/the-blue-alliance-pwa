## Developer notes

We use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to manage Git hooks.
In particular, Prettier and ESlint are used to format and lint code during pre-commit.
We recommend installing text editor plugins for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) and [ESlint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) to automatically format code and warn about any
errors during development.
